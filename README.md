[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anilgit90/libusb4java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anilgit90/libusb4java)

This is the source code of the JNI wrapper for libusb. usb4java
already includes pre-compiled libraries for the following platforms:

* linux-x86
* linux-x86_64
* linux-arm
* windows-x86
* windows-x86_64
* osx-x86
* osx-x86_64

If you need the library on an other platform then you can easily compile it
yourself.  On a Unix-compatible operating system you only need the Java JDK,
an up-to-date libusb library version, the GNU C compiler and cmake.  When
everything is correctly installed then you should be able to build the
library with the following commands:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
  
When compilation was successful then you can find the library in the
`build/src` directory.

usb4java searches for the library in the CLASSPATH directory
`org/libusb4java/<OS>-<ARCH>/`. On a 32 bit x86 linux machine for
example the directory name is `org/libusb4java/linux-x86`. Usually
you can find the required name in the exception thrown by usb4java when it
does not find the required library.
